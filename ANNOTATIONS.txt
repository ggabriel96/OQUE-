* Writing to invalid fields of a variable works right out of the box;
* Reading invalid positions yield "could not find variable" error;
* Gotta implement whole struct assignments (and throw an exception when trying something like: y = x[]);
* Nested commands don't work, for example: square(square(2)) or array[struct[field]];
