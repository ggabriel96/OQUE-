* Writing to invalid fields of a variable works right out of the box;
* Reading invalid positions yield "could not find variable" error;
* Nested commands don't work, for example: square(square(2)) or array[struct[field]];
* Cannot initialize a variable with a fn call in its declaration!;
* Assigning a function that doesn't return anything to a variable will reset its value to its type defaults, as if it was redeclared (type isn't changed);

> fix assignment of whole structures (work in progress)
