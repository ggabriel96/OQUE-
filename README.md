OQUE is an interpreted programming language developed on top of Java for an university assignment.
Here we provide a new implementation of the language, improving some functionalities already implemented and creating new ones. More information about this new version of OQUE can be found in our online presentation: https://prezi.com/axbobm6apu8k/interpretador-parte-ii/.
